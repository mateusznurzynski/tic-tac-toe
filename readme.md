# Tic-tac-toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game with 3 difficulty settings.

## Difficulties:

-   Easy - random moves
-   Medium - checks for one-move wins or loses
-   Hard - unbeatable, always makes the best move based on its value (if a few moves have the highest value, one of them is chosen randomly)
